        <h1>About Flappy Bird</h1>
        <p>Flappy Bird is a simple yet addictive mobile and laptop game developed by Erasz gaming company and originally released in 2024. The game gained immense popularity for its minimalist design and challenging gameplay.</p>
        <p>In Flappy Bird, players control a bird avatar that must navigate through a series of pipes protruding from the top and bottom of the screen. The objective is to fly the bird as far as possible without colliding with any obstacles. Each successful pass through a set of pipes earns the player a point, with the goal being to achieve the highest score possible.</p>
        <p>What sets Flappy Bird apart is its easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master mechanics. The controls are simple - players tap the screen to make the bird flap its wings and ascend slightly. However, the timing and precision required to maneuver through the narrow gaps between pipes make the game incredibly challenging.</p>
        <p>Despite its simple concept, Flappy Bird became a cultural phenomenon, amassing millions of downloads and inspiring countless clones and spin-offs. The game's addictive nature and competitive leaderboards kept players coming back for more, even as frustration mounted over the game's punishing difficulty.</p>
        <p>Although Flappy Bird was eventually removed from app stores by its creator due to its unexpected popularity and the developer's concerns over its addictive nature, its legacy lives on. The game continues to be fondly remembered by players and remains a testament to the power of simple, addictive gameplay.</p>
